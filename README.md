# Anthropometric-Analysis
End to end analysis of the impact that short stature has on the risk of Adiposity, Insulin Resistance &amp; Diabetes.

The primary objective of this project was to investigate the relationship between various 
stature-related measurements, including height, leg length, and leg length-to-height ratio, and
indicators of adiposity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. The study utilizes data
obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III,
conducted between 1988 and 1994.

This project recreates the results of the paper:
[Short Stature and the Risk of Adiposity, Insulin Resistance, and Type 2 Diabetes in Middle Age](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/29/7/1632/28668/Short-Stature-and-the-Risk-of-Adiposity-Insulin)

The raw data for this project can be found at [NHANES III](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhanes3/default.aspx)

How to run the code:
1. Run code_file_1 on the raw SAS and DAT files.
2. Store the processed files obtained from running code_file_1.
3. Run code_file_2 on the processed data.
